## PARKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
* In todayâ€™s time where people lack time and face many problems due to traffic caused by the cars parked anywhere in malls parking, finding where there parking spots are present, if yes will they be able to find it before others, there is a severe need for us to design an efficient parking system which can perform and automate all of the above processes and much more. So we will help you park like a pro and avoid wastage of time and also help in efficient parking of vehicles. 
* Our system will help you know if space for parking is available or not in a parking area. This will save time and efficiency of the driver trying to find a parking space.
* No more help needed for finding a spot and parking your vehicles.
* Parking spots will be pre- labeled and you will be guided to your dedicated spot provided by the system.
* Higher efficiency.

## Project Objectives and System Overview
* Ease in vehicle parking system in terms of position planning for drivers to park their vehicles.
* Helping in modulate the traffic by using scenario thinking.
* According to the limited space allowing vehicle parking space and modulating the entry and exit sides of the vehicle parking space.
* Displaying the parking space left on a LCD screen with their serial number helping driver to plan his way by following the number signs in the parking space to park their vehicle and if no space is available displaying all spots are full in the LCD screen.
* Hardware Requirements:
* Arduino Uno
* Breadboard
* 2 Servo Motors
* 5 IR Sensors
* Jump Wires
* 9V Battery

## Conclusion
# Challenges 
* Getting proper timing tuned for the opening and closing of the gates
* Sensor placement and tuning of the sensors range
* LCD display for how to let the driver know of the parking spaces
# Future Improvements 
* Using Raspberry Pi instead of Arduino enabling us to use and fuse computer vision and Machine learning algorithms with other sensors, leading to a better, more refined control system with database management of all the vehicles getting in and out. 
* Using more IR sensors at the entry and exit gates for better control.
* Better driver guidance for going to the free slots/slot.
* Better traffic management inside the parking space using computer vision.
